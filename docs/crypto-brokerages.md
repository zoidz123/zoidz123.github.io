# Crypto Brokerages

In the docs, crypto brokerages is used extensively but loosely to refer to a mix of retail trading venues. In traditional finance, a "stock brokerage" means something very specific and people tend to think of the household names like Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, Charles Schwab, E-Trade etc.

In crypto, a "brokerage" may not elicit the same response due to both the nascency of the entire industry and fundamental differences between a blockchain financial system (e.g. permissionless,...) and the traditional system.

## Breaking Down Crypto Brokerages

An overview of who they are.

As mentioned, wallets like MetaMask and Phantom control the majority of on-chain retail volume. They are the closest to potential users and are the entrypoints to DeFi.

Aggregators like 1Inch and Jupiter Aggregator aggregate many liquidity sources to find the best price for users. DeFi is fragmented and it's a natural move to consolidate retail trading activity.

Portfolio dashboards apps like Zapper and Zerion are like the "frontpages" of crypto and offer convenient swapping venues for users.
