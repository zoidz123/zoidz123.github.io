## DFlow: The First OF (Order Flow) Marketplace

DFlow is the interface for interacting with the DFlow Protocol and allows crypto brokerages to sell order flow to market makers on an open marketplace. DFlow is considered a primary (i.e. does not support resale of order flow) or wholesale market. In a traditional wholesale market, a business buys supplies or materials straight from the manufacturer. On DFlow, market makers buy order flow directly from the brokerage.

### Users

The two groups of users on DFlow are the brokerages and market makers. On DFlow, brokerages can create, manage, monitor, and analyze order flow auctions. On the other side, market makers submit bids into auctions. The winner of the auction receive the exclusive right to fill the underlying orders.

### More Than A B2B Marketplace

The benefit of an active and market-driven order flow marketplace does not only benefit the immediate two parties involved (e.g. crypto brokerages and market makers). The most important beneficiary is the group of individual traders who trade on the venues that are routing order flow to DFlow.

### Retail Deserves The Best

DFlow is built with the everyday trader in mind. Crypto brokerages selling order flow on DFlow can also unlock the following features:

- [x] Offer 0 fee swapping. No hidden fees. Neither DFlow nor participating market makers take a trading or "convenience" fee.
- [x] Guarantee best execution. The DFlow PFOF model uses a decentralized price oracle to ensure market makers fill at the best available market price.
- [x] Deliver real cost savings. Market makers often fill at better than market prices, resulting in price and size improvements.
