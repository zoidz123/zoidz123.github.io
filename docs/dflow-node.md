# DFlow Node

DFlow Protocol is made up of a network of decentralized nodes that validate transactions and host order flow auctions on the DFlow appchain. During the initial phase of launch, DFlow will run the first set of nodes.

_(This section will be updated as we get closer to decentralizing DFlow validators.)_
