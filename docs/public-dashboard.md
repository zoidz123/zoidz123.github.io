# Public Dashboard

DFlow is committed to creating a fair and transparent PFOF model. In addition to allowing anyone to track order flow auction performance, order execution quality, order flow toxicity etc., the DFlow Public Dashboard will display live market prices for all order flow on the network.

This Public Dashboard will be bundled with the [DFlow Wallet Dashboard](wallet-dashboard.md) as one product for the general public.

Both products are coming soon.
