# Getting Started

This section will detail the onboarding process for both order flow sources (i.e. wallets, swappers, aggregators) and market makers.

## Order Flow Sources

Order flow sources will need to complete a simple setup process of running an Endorsement Server and integrating with the Signatory Server to be able to create order flow auctions and route orders to the appropriate auctions.

After the initial setup, order flow sources will primarily use the DFlow Dashboard to create and manage auctions, and carry out other day-to-day business operations.

## Market Makers

Market makers will bid into first-price sealed-bid auctions and follow a bid-reveal scheme which prevents bidding wars. The winner of an auction epoch receives the exclusive right to fill the underlying orders of the auction epoch.
