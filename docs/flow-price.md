# Flow price

## A market-based order flow price improves transparency and price discovery

A _flow price_ is the price to fill a specific token pair's order flow, as calculated from market maker payments over time. A marketplace for order flow means order flow can be priced, for the first time.

In traditional equities, PFOF is conducted behind-the-scenes over contracts between the brokerage firm and the market maker (e.g. Robinhood and Citadel). Price and contract terms are both opaque, and clearly, this is a nonideal form of price discovery of order flow.

Order flow belongs to the users. By introducing live, market-based pricing for order flow, DFlow brings transparency to the gated PFOF model found in traditional stock markets. Crypto brokerages can also take advantage of live public order flow prices to make calculations on what that means for their existing order flow.

### Where to see order flow prices

Order flow pricing will be shown like stock prices and be an integral part of the [DFlow interface](wallet-dashboard.md). Prices are retrieved live from DFlow auctions, where market makers compete by bidding into auctions.
