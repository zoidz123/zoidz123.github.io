# Flow Price

A marketplace for order flow means order flow can be priced, for the first time. Transparent and competitive order flow pricing lets crypto brokerages see a live price for their order flow and is a proxy for amount of MEV / value returned to users.

## Pricing Order Flow

In traditional equities, payment-for-order-flow is conducted behind-the-scenes over contracts between the brokerage firm and the market maker (e.g. Robinhood and Citadel). Price and contract terms are both opaque, and clearly, this is a nonideal form of price discovery of order flow.

## Transparent Market Prices, _For the First Time_

Order flow belongs to the users. By introducing live, market-based pricing for order flow, DFlow brings transparency to the gated payment-for-order-flow model found in traditional stock and options markets.

Prices are retrieved live from DFlow auctions, where market makers compete by bidding into auctions to win rights to fill orders of a specific token pair.

Order flow pricing will be an integral part of the [DFlow Public Dashboard](public-dashboard.md), which will be released soon. Crypto brokerages can also take advantage of live public order flow prices to make calculations on what that means for their existing order flow.
