# Depositing / Withdrawing Funds

DFlow Protocol is built as a Cosmos based blockchain, which means if you are an order flow source or market maker participating on DFlow, you will have to bridge over USDC for auction creation and bidding, respectively.

## Deposit / Withdraw Process

The entire deposit and withdraw process will be an intuitive process done through the DFlow interface.

### Asset

For now, the bridge only supports USDC transfers between Solana and DFlow. E.g. if you are a Ethereum brokerage, you will need to create an account on Solana.

### Time

Transfer should be confirmed within a few minutes.
