# Depositing / Withdrawing Funds

DFlow is built as a Cosmos based blockchain, which means if you are an order flow source or market maker participating in the DFlow network, you will have to bridge over USDC for auction creation and bidding, respectively.

## Deposit / Withdraw Process

The entire deposit and withdraw process will be an intuitive process done through the DFlow Wallet Dashboard or DFlow MM Dashboard.

### Asset

The bridge only supports USDC transfers between Solana and DFlow.

### Time

Transfer should be confirmed within a few minutes.
