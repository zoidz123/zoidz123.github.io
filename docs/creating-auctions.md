# Creating Auctions

Before routing orders to DFlow, you must have already created order flow auctions on DFlow. Each [order flow auction](order-flow-auction.md) is like a contract and represents a unique grade of order flow, as determined by a set of parameters.

You have the flexibility to tranche user orders based on specific wants and needs. Market makers will view auction specs and submit bids in a first-price sealed-bid manner.

The creation of order flow auctions is made intuitive by the DFlow Dashboard, which will be released upon the launch of its decentralized order flow markets.

## DFlow Dashboard

The [DFlow Dashboard](dashboard.md) serves as the hassle-free control center for wallets to enable a robust order flow selling business. The main use cases of the dashboard are to allow you to create and manage auctions, and view payments received from market makers.

## Deposit USDC

Creating auctions on DFlow requires a one-time flat fee of 1 USDC. This is to reduce network spam.
