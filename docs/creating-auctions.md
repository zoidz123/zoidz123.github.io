# Creating Auctions

The first step to selling order flow on DFlow is creating order flow auctions through the DFlow interface.

Each [order flow auction](order-flow-auction.md) represents a unique grade of order flow, as determined by a set of user-defined parameters. You have the flexibility to tranche user orders based on specific wants and needs. Market makers will view auction specs and submit bids in first-price sealed-bid auctions.

## Create Auction On The DFlow Interface

The DFlow interface serves as the hassle-free control center for order flow sources and enables them to sell order flow to market makers in competitive and transparent auctions. The interface allows you to create and manage auctions, view payments received from market makers, transfer funds to DFlow etc.

Creating auctions on DFlow requires a one-time flat fee in USDC to reduce network spam. Deposit or withdraw USDC [using the DFlow USDC Bridge](depositing-withdrawing.md).
