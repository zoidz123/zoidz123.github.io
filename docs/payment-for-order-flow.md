# Payment For Order Flow

Payment-for-order-flow (PFOF) refers to market makers paying brokerage firms for their order flow. In other words, brokerages monetize their orders because of the inherent value in retail order flow.

This is a win-win situation for all participants because:

1. **Retail traders receive order fills at better prices.** Market makers can fill orders at better prices than on exchanges because they face less adverse selection when market making retail order flow. In fact, in traditional equities, market makers compete with each other to deliver the most price improvement to win contracts with leading retail brokerages.
2. **Brokerage firms generate revenue from market makers who pay for their order flow.** Exchanges don't pay brokerage firms for their order flow.
3. **Market makers have a more sustainable and stable business model.** Because market makers face much less adverse selection risk, they do not have to worry about prices moving against them immediately after filling orders. As a result, they can fill orders at tighter spreads and consistently earn the bid-ask spread over time.

### Why is PFOF viewed negatively then?

In traditional markets, PFOF has been criticized for lack of transparency behind order execution and arrangements between brokerages and market makers. The issue is they are not measurable or verifiable by anyone. The general distrust of traditional financial entities also doesn't help the narrative.

    DFlow is reinventing the traditional PFOF model using a retail-first approach. By putting a heavy emphasis on transparency and fairness, DFlow algorithmically ensures best order execution.
