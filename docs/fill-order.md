# Fill Order

If you are the winning market maker of an auction epoch, you will receive the exclusive right to fill the underlying order flow up to the `Notional` amount or until the end of the `Generic Epoch Delivery Period` (or `Genesis Epoch Delivery Period` for the first epoch).

If you choose to not fill the orders, you will forfeit the bid amount and the rest of the orders will be routed to the `Backup Liquidity Provider` specified in the auction.
